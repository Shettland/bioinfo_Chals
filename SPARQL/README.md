## What is SPARQL?

SPARQL is a query language for querying and manipulating RDF (Resource Description Framework) data. It is similar to SQL and is used to query data stored in a triplestore or RDF graph. SPARQL allows for complex queries, including the ability to join multiple RDF graphs. It is widely used in the semantic web and linked data community. It can be used to extract data from a variety of sources including RDF files, triplestore databases, and SPARQL endpoints.

In this case, the assignment that was given to the students only included a few questions to answer using SPARQL queries. Both the questions, the answers and the code that was used to obtain them are located in a jupyter-notebook [SPARQL_Answers.ipynb](SPARQL_Answers.ipynbs/).
